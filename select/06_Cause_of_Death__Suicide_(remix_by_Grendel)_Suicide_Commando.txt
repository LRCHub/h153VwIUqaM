One death, one try
Are you sure?
Do you really want to die?
One life, one cry
Go away, you're nothing but a lie
One shot and you'll die
In the head, in the center of the eyes
One gun, one try
My god, do you really want to die?

Do you really want to die?
One death, one try
Are you sure? Do you really want to die?
One step, one try
On the edge, do you really want to try?
One tempt, one cry
I can't cope, I no longer want this life
One rope, one try
My god, do you really want to die?

Do you really want to die?
Do you?
