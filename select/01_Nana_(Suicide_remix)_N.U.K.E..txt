II am the fly on the wall my prying eyes are looking through
II your bottom drawer I just came flying through your door
II you didn't notice that your number had been called. I see
II the mother who's beating the babe, I see the money, the
II pennies you save, stored on computers from birth to the
Grave the fly on the wall he's seeing it all. I am the
Fly upon the wall you're in the index of the files that stand
So tall although your health is rather poor we have a
Place for those who cannot find a cure. I know your income
Your daily crust I know your pleasures, your passion, your lust
I know when you're living and I know when you're dust the
Fly on the wall he's seeing it all. one is born and one will
Die, it's all understood the bit that's in the middle doesn't count
I am the fly on the wall my prying eyes are looking through
Your bottom drawer I just came flying through your door
You didn't notice that your number had been called. I see
The mother who's beating the babe, I see the money, the
Pennies you save, stored on computers from birth to the
Grave the fly on the wall he's seeing it all. I am the fly
Upon the wall you're in the index of the files that stand
So tall although your health is rather poor we have a
Place for those who cannot find a cure. I know your income
Your daily crust I know your pleasures, your passion, your lust
I know when you're living and I know when you're dust the
Fly on the wall he's seeing it all.
