I feel it slipping away
I feel it slipping away
I gave it all
but no one cared
I feel it slipping away

I feel it slipping away
my god it's slipping away
I gave it all
but no one cared
I feel it slipping away

I feel it slipping
I feel it slipping
I feel it slipping
I feel it slipping away

I feel it slipping away
I feel it slipping away
no more pain
no more fear
I feel it slipping away
I feel it slipping
I feel it slipping
I feel it slipping
I feel it slipping away

I just can't learn to forget
now I'm choking on the memories
choking on regret
I tried but I can't find a way
to untangle all the pieces
after they've been thrown away
I feel it slipping
I feel it slipping
I feel it slipping
I feel it slipping away

I will not suffer this loss
of you again and again and again
I refuse to continue to live
in this perpetual nightmare
I decide it ends right here
I feel it slipping
I feel it slipping
I feel it slipping
I feel it slipping away

I feel it slipping
I feel it slipping
everything is slipping away
